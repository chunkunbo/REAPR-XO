# REAPR-XO
As we use original REAPR (https://github.com/ted-xie/REAPR), we found that generate Xilinx Object files first and then compile using these files help to reduce the overall compilation time.
In this reporsitory, we provide a new workflow for this purpose. Similar to use REAPR, we provide a entry file (run.sh) under REAPR-XO/pcie_integration/rtl_prj/.
Users need to modify certain fields in order to run REAPR-XO.
